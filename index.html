        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>
          My journey began with a pursuit of architecture at university, a field
          that intrigued me but ultimately wasn’t the right fit. This
          realization led me to a significant career shift. Driven by a passion
          for technology and problem-solving, I completed a comprehensive
          bootcamp at Northcoders, where I immersed myself in software
          development. During this transformative experience, I acquired a solid
          foundation in coding and had the opportunity to work on several
          exciting projects. One notable project was a mobile app developed with
          Flutter, where I designed and implemented key features that enhanced
          user experience and functionality. This project not only showcased my
          technical skills but also my ability to tackle complex challenges
          creatively. I am now enthusiastic about leveraging my expertise and
          project experience to contribute to dynamic and forward-thinking
          teams, where I can continue to innovate and grow in the tech industry.

            <p>
              Transform your ideas into intuitive and visually compelling
              digital experiences. I specialize in creating user interfaces that
              are not only aesthetically pleasing but also enhance user
              satisfaction through effective design solutions. From wireframes
              to final designs, I ensure every element is crafted to meet user
              needs and business goals.

              Bring your vision to life with dynamic and responsive websites. As
              a frontend developer, I build engaging and interactive interfaces
              using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus

            <p>
              Ensure your application runs smoothly behind the scenes with
              robust backend solutions. I develop the server-side logic and
              manage databases to provide a reliable and scalable foundation for
              your project. From API development to server management, I handle
              the technical aspects to support a seamless user experience.

            A comprehensive job management system that enables users to add,
            edit, and delete job listings. Built with a custom API using Express
            and MongoDB, this platform provides a robust backend to handle job
            data efficiently, offering a seamless experience for users managing
            job-related information.

          <h3>Python Voice Assistant</h3>
          <p>
            I built a virtual assistant using Python that allows users to
            interact via speech. The assistant utilizes OpenAI’s language model
            to process natural language queries and fetch relevant information.
            It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time
            weather updates based on user input. The assistant can respond to
            voice commands and provide spoken feedback, making it a hands-free,
            interactive experience.

          <h3>ShopReact</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a E-Commerce Admin Dashboard using React, Redux Toolkit
            Query, and Material UI, designed to provide comprehensive insights
            into customer data, sales performance, and transactions. This
            project includes responsive data grids, interactive charts, and
            secure API integration with Node.js/Express and MongoDB for backend
            services. It allows admins to manage products, view real-time
            metrics, and make data-driven decisions with ease, offering a clean
            and intuitive user experience across all devices.
